# siomiz/node-opencv

## [node-opencv](https://github.com/peterbraden/node-opencv) is currently not compatible with OpenCV 3+
Please use siomiz/node-opencv**:2.4.x** [![2.4.x Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/siomiz/node-opencv.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/siomiz/node-opencv) in the meantime.

### <s>Docker Automated Build Repository/Image for node:latest + opencv 3.1.0</s>

Official Node.js "latest" image + OpenCV <s>3.1.0</s> (built from [source][1], not a full stack) for `npm install opencv` to work.

`onbuild` tag is available.

(simpler way is to `apt-get install libopencv-dev` inside a `node`-based image)
